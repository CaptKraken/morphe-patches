# Native playlist queue — incremental phone-test builds

Patch an untouched **YouTube 21.20.405 APK** with the selected local MPP source. Native playlist queue stays selected by default. Each bundle includes earlier features; each feature has its own source commit. Phone checks remain pending until performed on a device.

## Step 3: complete native card information

[Download MPP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptKraken/morphe-patches/builds/youtube-native-playlist-queue/native-playlist-queue-21.20.405-step3-card-info.mpp) · [Source 7b2147f05](https://github.com/CaptKraken/morphe-patches/tree/7b2147f05ac0a615e12496e5a215d0d41d352249)

Native rows now include full collaborating-channel text, views/age and duration badges. Complete captured cards avoid a lookup; incomplete rows use a bounded background Android search projection with exact video-ID matching. Title policies remain effective and late completion updates only an owned active queue. Native UI is reused, with no auto-expansion. Optional missing/private/unindexed metadata retains its fallback. Ratings, row playback and removal are not included in this particular milestone.

Phone checks:

1. Add waZyE4Xl6bo from Watch Later while a normal video plays; wait briefly, then confirm Starbound Extra and Starbound HFY, views/age and29:04 on the queued row.
2. Check Home/recommendations and long channel names against the native playlist style.
3. Close the player before a lookup completes and open an account playlist; the queue must not reopen or replace it. Confirm additions still show a toast without expanding the panel.

9 tests passed;5 existing Jam APK-dependent tests skipped. Stock21.20.405 patch application with9related patches and SDK DEX/resource checks passed with the queue selected and unselected. All20 captured native cards retained channel/info/duration. Exact reported-video lookup projection returned both collaborators and full metadata. Final Android MPP build/default=true check passed. Phone behavior remains unverified.

Earlier step 1/2 bundles remain in this branch. LICENSE and NOTICE are preserved; only distribution manifest metadata differs from build output.
